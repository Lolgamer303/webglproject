# WebGL Showcase Project

Welcome to my WebGL Showcase Project! This project is a personal endeavor to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of WebGL in creating interactive 3D graphics within a web application.

## Project Overview

This project leverages WebGL to render stunning 3D graphics directly in the browser. It is built using React to manage the user interface and interactions, providing a seamless and dynamic experience. The power of ray marching is showcased through the rendering of simple shapes.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models**: Explore and interact with a world of 3D models.
- **Real-time Rendering**: Experience smooth and real-time rendering of graphics.
- **Ray Marching**: Demonstrates the power of ray marching to render simple shapes.
**Please note that this project is not responsive and can be hard to use on a small devices.**

## Technologies Used

- **WebGL**: For rendering 3D graphics.
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library that makes WebGL easier to use.
